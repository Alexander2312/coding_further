# Ruby on Rails

At Le Wagon you learn our beloved Ruby and Rails - and there is a lot more to find out about it, have a look at these tutorials:

- https://gorails.com/series - a plethora of tutorials
- https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/ (they also have courses on advanced git!)

# Code Katas

If you need to prepare for that next interview, have a look at code katas. But don't get frustrated - these challenges are at the verge of coding, problem solving and mathematical skills which is a very specific skill of itself.

# Javascript resources

Javascript is one of the coding languages with the furthest reach ( [see Gihub](https://octoverse.github.com/projects#languages) )and has been in the top ten ever since. Find

javascript.info/
https://learnjavascript.online/
https://wesbos.com/courses/ (paid courses! - but Wagon alumni have gotten reductions before when they bought in bulks, so shooting him a message might be worth it) if you want to see if you like his teaching style, check out his free course:

# Newsletters/ News pages

In order to be up to date and get informed about the latest changes, newsletters and news pages are really helpful.
ruby newsletter is a good start as it is the offical newsletter and has a nice mixture of offical announcements, tutorials and hints.

Of course I have to mention Dimitris `Turbo Breakfast` with curated picks from tech, economics, design and things that make the web beautiful.
