# Ruby on Rails

At Le Wagon you learn our beloved Ruby and Rails - and there is a lot more to find out about it, have a look at these tutorials:

- https://gorails.com/series - a plethora of tutorials
- https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/ (they also have courses on advanced git!)

# Code Katas

If you need to prepare for that next interview, have a look at code katas. But don't get frustrated - these challenges are at the verge of coding, problem solving and mathematical skills which is a very specific skill of itself.

# Javascript resources

Javascript is one of the coding languages with the furthest reach ([according to GitHub survey](https://octoverse.github.com/projects#languages)) and has been in the top ten ever since. Time to master it with these tutorials:

- https://javascript.info/ a very extensive course with a lot of small and interesting details covered - more than just the average course!
https://learnjavascript.online/ - made by a long-term teacher for Le Wagon and expert in his field [Jad](https://jadjoubran.io/)
https://wesbos.com/courses/ - Wes Bos is famous for his video courses (paid courses! - but Wagon alumni have gotten reductions before when they bought in bulks, so shooting him a message might be worth it) if you want to see if you like his teaching style, check out his free course:

# Newsletters/ News pages

In order to be up to date and get informed about the latest changes, newsletters and news pages are really helpful.


- https://rubyweekly.com/ is a good start as it is the offical newsletter and has a nice mixture of news on the Ruby language, tutorials and hints

- https://tinyletter.com/turbobreakfast of course I have to mention Dimitris (teacher and developer for Le Wagon Berlin) `Turbo Breakfast` with curated picks from tech, economics, design and things that make the web beautiful.

- https://gigitherobot.com/ - This is a newsletter addressed to women and their tagline describe them best: "the important stories you donâ€™t gloss over when you hear the word 'tech'."

Community/News page:

- https://dev.to/ (the page is built in Rails)
